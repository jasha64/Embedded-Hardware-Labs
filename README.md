Here is the code of my two elective courses in hardware.



### Arduino

A battery stack monitor demonstration circuit. Main feature includes: drawing input data into a chart with C#; interacting with device registers to activate passive battery cell balancing.

**Hardware**: Linear Technology DC2026C microcontroller board(Linduino® One), DC2350AB 18-cell battery stack monitor, DC1941 isoSPI receiver

**Environment**: Visual Studio; Arduino IDE



### LeapMotion

Somatosensory controller program of computer games, using LeapMotion®

**Hardware**: LeapMotion® somatosensory controller

**Environment**: Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA



### USART Comm
